# Grandma's Recipes – Frontend (Vue.js)

Client-side implementation for the full-stack project **"Grandma's Recipes and More"**, developed as part of the Web Development Environments course.

## Overview

This Vue.js 3 + BootstrapVue application serves as the frontend of a recipe management platform.  
It allows users to **search**, **view**, **save**, and **create** recipes – including personal and family recipes – while communicating with an Express.js + MySQL backend.

The UI is designed with a pastel aesthetic using images to match the colors.

## Key Features

-  User authentication: register, login, logout
-  Recipe search (with cuisine, diet, and intolerance filters)
-  Sort search results by preparation time or popularity
-  Live indicators: viewed and favorited
-  Detailed recipe view including ingredients & instructions
-  Favorite any recipe (API or user-generated)
-  Create personal and family recipes with a clean modal form
-  Family recipe section with our family recipes and user-submitted
-  Personal area with saved, created, and family recipes
-  Polished and responsive design with BootstrapVue & transitions
-  Session-based login using HTTP-only cookies

## Backend Integration

The frontend uses `axios` to send HTTP requests to the backend server.  
You can run the app against:

- **Local backend**: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- **Production server**: `https://noa-yaki.cs.bgu.ac.il`

> Ensure the backend is up and running before launching the frontend.
